Hello.
I want to tell something happened , played to version 4.2 which appeared obelisks , my first impression was wow ! perhaps was the vacuum or space that looked at the obelisk.
But when you upgrade to the latest version 4.3.3 , on the obelisk not fully see nothing just a white bar with two obsidian blocks on each side.
What I want to know is what is some bug ? Maybe my computer?
I wonder :s .Thanks in advance.
